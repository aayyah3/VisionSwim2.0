### About MedLaunch:
We are a student-led organization at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign with a focus on making our community a more accessible place. Coming from all different majors and perspectives, we work with individuals with disabilities in the Champaign-Urbana area to design, build, and deliver devices that improve their independence and quality of life. We are strong believers in the social model of disability, and the core of our mission is to work with the disability community, not for them.

### VisionSwim2.0

This is the code for this iteration, developed by **Ryan Sullivan, Aditya Dave, Akshaya Ayyah, Anish Mehta, Dwij Bhatt, Ishaan Aggarwal, Mariana Van Eycke, Reyna Alam, and Samuel Biruduganti**.
